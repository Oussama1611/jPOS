## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you've found a vulnerability, please use the _Report a vulnerability_ button found in the [security tab](https://github.com/jpos/jPOS/security) of the project on Github or contact security at jpos dot org.

This process is documented in GitHub's _Secure Coding_ guide: [Privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
